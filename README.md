## A Note on Passwords

We **never** store passwords in our database. Instead, we use a hashing function to create a password hash or digest. We store the password digest in our database.

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication

Here is a flow for using JWT for Authentication

1. The user signs up:

- The client creates a POST request to the `/signup` endpoint on the server with username, email, and password in the request body

2. The server creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) based on a header, payload, and secret
3. The server responds with the JWT
4. The client saves the JWT in localStorage to persist subsequent server requests

Answer the following questions:

1. Why do we need authentication in our Web Apps?

```
To prevent breaches into areas of the Web App we'd like to remain secure.
```

2. What is the point of a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction)? Why would we want to use it?

```
JWT's are encrypted containers that securely transfer information between two parties. It allows for authentication without revealing necessary information (ie: passwords).
```

3. Why would we hash a user's password when they sign up? What's the point?

```
Hashing a users password onscreen is used in an effort to disclose the password from any onlookers.
```

4. Go [here](https://jwt.io). Create a JWT with the following as the payload (feel free to change the username/email):

```js
{
  "id": "1",
  "username": "bruno",
  "email": "bruno@ga.co"
}
```

Paste your encoded JWT below:
